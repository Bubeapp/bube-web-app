          </p>

          <p>
            4.2. You must have all licenses, permits, automobile insurance, liability
            insurance (if applicable), registrations, certificates, and other papers
            necessary in your jurisdiction to provide Transportation Services. You must

            verification of licenses, approvals, authorization, registrations, and
            certificates.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3 You must offer Transportation Services professionally and ethically, and
            you must endeavor to accomplish what the Passenger desires. You must, among
            other things: I take the least expensive route for the Passenger, unless the
            Passenger asks you to take a different route; (ii) don't stop without
            permission; (iii) don't let anyone ride in the car except the Passenger and
            the Passenger's passengers; and (iv) follow all traffic laws and rules,
            which means you can't do anything that could make driving or perception of
            traffic conditions harder, like hold your phone while driving

          <p>
            4.4 You determine when Transportation Services are offered. Passenger
            requests for transportation services might be accepted, rejected, or
            ignored.

            4.5: Transportation expenses. You must pay for and maintain all
            Transportation Services tools and equipment, such as a vehicle, smartphone,

            unlimited or large data plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.7 Fares. When you accept a Bube passenger and offer transportation, you
            may charge a price (i.e. Fare). The cost is based on a default base fare,
            the GPS-determined journey distance, and the trip duration. Local market
            conditions may affect the basic fare. Send us a signed request to discuss
            the Fare. You may charge less than the Bube app's Fare at any moment. Bube
            Fee doesn't decrease if passenger pays less than app suggests.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.7 Up-front pricing. A traveler might agree to a set charge for a certain
            Transportation Service you supply (i.e Upfront Fare). The Bube app gives
            passengers the upfront fare before they order a trip and at the conclusion
            of the journey. If the passenger's destination changes during the journey,
            if the ride takes longer than planned due to traffic or other causes, or if
            other unforeseen occurrences occur, the Section 4.6 Fare will be applied
            instead of the Upfront Fare (e.g a route is used where tolls apply).
          </p>

          <p>
            4.8. If you detect a fare calculation error and wish to change it, contact
            support. If a petition from "support" is not issued, Bube will not
            recalculate the Fare or refund you for an error.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.9. Bube may adjust the Fare for a completed order if we identify a
            violation (such as choosing a longer route or not stopping the fee meter on
            the Bube App) or a technical fault that impacts the final fare. Bube may
            decrease or cancel your fare if we detect fraud or if a passenger complains
            you breached the rules. Bube will only decrease or cancel fares when it's
            fair and reasonable.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.10 A passenger may pay you directly or via In-app Payment, as specified in
            section 6 of these General Terms. If the Passenger pays directly, you must
            collect. If the Passenger doesn't pay, Bube will issue a notice of debt on
            your behalf. This authorization comes from the paying agent's instructions
            to Bube, but Bube doesn't have to make up the fare. If the vehicle's
            occupants don't pay the Fare, the Passenger who hired the service will. Bube
            won't pay if a passenger refuses to pay because of incorrect information in
            the app.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.11 Receipts, Bube must send the Passenger a receipt with the company's
            name and address, the Driver's first and last name, a photo of the Driver,
            the Driver's service license number (if applicable), the vehicle's
            registration number, the date, the time, the start and end locations, the
            duration and length, the Fare, and the Fare paid for successful
            Transportation Services. You may access your receipts via your Bube Driver
            Account.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.12 Cancellation/waiting fees. Through the Bube app, a Passenger may cancel
            an agreed-upon ride. If a Passenger cancels an approved request for
            Transportation Services after a Bube App-set time limit, the Driver is
            entitled to the Fare.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.13. If a Passenger or fellow passenger negligently destroys the vehicle or
            its furnishings (by leaving scratches or stains on the vehicle or making it
            smell terrible), you may require the Passenger to pay a fine of up to 50,000
            Naira and seek for reimbursement for any damages that are larger than the
            fine. If a passenger refuses to pay a fee or repair damage, tell us. We'll
            endeavour to collect the fine and/or fees from the Passenger. We're not
            liable for any harm the Passenger does to the vehicle's cleaning or
            maintenance.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.14: Taxes. You agree to satisfy all transportation-related tax
            requirements. This includes paying income tax, social security tax, or any
            other relevant tax and satisfying all employee and tax registration duties
            for accounting and transfers to State authorities, as required by law. If
            the Tax authorities requests information about you, we may supply it to the
            degree allowed by law. You must also observe any tax requirements that
            relate to your Transportation Services. You agree to pay Bube any state
            fees, claims, payments, penalties, or other tax liabilities due to your tax
            violations (including paying the income tax and social tax).
          </p>

          <p>
            Permission to bill the driver. Bube may send a passenger an invoice on your
            behalf for Fares, contractual penalties, or other expenses. Your Bube Driver
            Account will have the bill.
          </p>

          <h5>5. Bube</h5>

          <p>
            Bube Services cost money (i.e. the Bube Fee). Bube Fee is dependent on each
            Transportation Service order you've completed. You may discover the Bube Fee
            through e-mail, the Bube app, or your Bube Driver Account. Bube Fees may
            vary. Each modification will be announced in advance.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.2 You have until the 15th of the next month to pay the Bube Fee and other
            costs. You must pay 0.1 percent of the outstanding Bube Fee every day if you
            pay late. You must cover all debt collection charges.
          </p>

          <h5>In-app payments</h5>

          <p>
            6.1. We may enable Passengers pay for the Bube app using cards, carrier
            bills, and other means (Bube Business, etc). You grant us permission to
            collect Fares or other fees paid by Passengers through In-app Payment as
            your limited commercial agency. Once a Passenger makes an In-app Payment,
            their payment obligation is satisfied.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.2 You can't deny or stop a Passenger from utilizing In-app Payment. If you
            decline an In-app Payment without a solid explanation, we may charge you
            10,000 Naira each refusal and/or revoke your permission to use Bube
            Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bube may provide riders discount coupons as they deem appropriate, depending
            on the campaign. You can only accept a promo code when a rider pays with a
            card in the app. Coupons aren't valid for cash-paid vacations. Bube may
            revoke a promo code and not pay a Driver if they utilized it fraudulently,
            illegally, or against our terms and conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.4 Your Bube Driver Account or App has In-app Payment reports. The reports
            will display In-App Payment earnings and Bube Fee deductions. You must tell
            us about any occurrences that may affect how we collect and distribute app
            Fares.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.5 We are not bound to pay you the Passenger's Fare if the In-app Payment
            fails owing to a cancelled credit card or other payment. We'll assist you
            ask the Passenger for the Fare and email it to you after they pay.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before giving Transportation Services to a Passenger, ensure sure it's the
            proper Passenger or that the Passenger has written permission for others to
            travel on his or her account. If you mistakenly charge the In-app Payment to
            a person who hasn't been authorized or approved Transportation Services for
            other passengers, we'll refund the Fare. We won't give you the Fare if that
            occurs. If you misuse an In-app Payment, we may fine you up to 10 euros.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.7. Any app-paid Fares will be deducted from your bill (i.e. Bube Fees and
            contractual penalties). We may sue you if you owe money to Bube. We may
            utilize your debts to pay off our own.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.8 If we can't pay you the Fees because your bank account information is
            missing or incorrect, we'll hold the payment for 180 days. If you don't
            provide the correct bank account information within 180 days of when you
            were granted the opportunity to claim compensation, your claim for the

Market overviews. We may provide you market overviews through the Bube App, Bube Driver Account, SMS, e-mail, or other means so you know when most Passengers need trips. These market overviews are ideas and aren't binding. Since the market overview projections are based on previous data, we can't guarantee they'll be accurate.

Minimum-wage campaigns. We may also run campaigns that promise money if you supply Transportation Services within a particular period. We'll compensate if you don't attain the minimum. The Bube app, Bube driver account, SMS, email, or another mechanism will provide the rules and regulations. We select whether, when, and to whom Drivers to provide campaigns. If we suspect fraud, we may hold your Fare until we're sure.

Passenger advertising. We may also undertake Passenger campaigns to promote Bube. If passengers' fares go lower due to our campaign, we'll reimburse you the value of the benefit. Bube Cost advertisement fee might be subtracted.
