          <h2>Passenger Terms and Conditions</h2>

          <p>
            These terms and conditions describe how to use the Bube app. Bube links
            passengers and drivers to make city travel simpler.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bube , a private limited company incorporated and registered under the laws
            of Republic of Nigeria with registration code 1924392.
          </p>

          <h4>Bube app use</h4>

          <p>
            The Bube app links individuals who need rides with drivers. Bube doesn't
            provide transport. Contract-based drivers carry people (with you). Drivers
            provide transportation services alone or via a corporation. Professional and
            cost-effective. Bube isn't responsible for enforcing the passenger-driver
            agreement. Passengers and drivers may quarrel about consumer rights, legal
            duties, or transportation laws. Bube's app lists drivers and their services.
            Receipts are emailed to the passenger's email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2 As a passenger, you arrange transportation using the Bube app. Depending
            on your trip's location, you may pay the driver with cash or with Bube
            in-App Payment. Bube pays Separate agreements cover business travel. Prices
            include legal taxes. Booking costs, municipal tolls, airport surcharges, and
            split payment processing fees may also be charged. You may tip the driver
            directly or using Bube in-App Payment. We may limit a Tip's value.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3 A passenger's phone number is connected to their Bube account when they
            install the app. Bube must be notified within 7 days if you no longer use
            your mobile number. Your cell operator may give out your old number if you
            don't inform us. If they utilize Bube, they can access your data.
          </p>

          <h4>Promo coupons</h4>

          <p>
            2.1 Bube may send separate promo coupons. A promotional code may be used to
            pay for a ride or gain additional features or advantages from the service or
            a Third Party. Each promotional code has restrictions. Once you add a
            discount code, the app will display its expiry date.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2 If your journey costs more than your credit, the difference will be
            instantly deducted. A coupon code is good for one ride. It's gone since it
            can't be utilized again. One voucher per trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bube may revoke any discount coupon at any moment. This includes if Bube
            believes the codes are being used unlawfully or fraudulently, were handed
            out by mistake, or have expired.
          </p>

          <h5>3. Bube in-app payment</h5>

          <p>
            3.1 Depending on the travel location, you may pay for Bube services using a
            credit card, cell carrier billing, or other means (like Bube Business). Bube
            works as a business agent for transportation firms by allowing in-app
            payments. Every motorist has granted Bube authorization to serve as their
            business agent. This includes letting Bube take passenger payments for
            drivers. When you send money to Bubes' bank account, you've satisfied your
            service provider's commitment. As a passenger, you must pay and have
            adequate money.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2 You may tip using Bube In-app Payment. The Tip may be purchased with
            Bube In-App Payment. Bube won't take a percentage of the Tip as a brokering
            charge; the driver will get the entire amount, less taxes. Bube may withhold
            a tip if it was paid fraudulently, unlawfully, for a cause other than a tip
            for the service, or in a manner that violates its terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.3 Bube transfers the driver the money when you pay using in-app payment.
            Bube may ask for extra payment details.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4 Bube is not liable for third-party payment expenses while using Bube
            in-app Payment (e.g mobile operators, bank fees). These service providers
            may impose additional fees for Bube in-App Payments. Bube doesn't cover
            these payments. Your payment method may be subject to third-party
            restrictions and limitations. Before using your payment method, read these
            terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.5 Bube will ensure in-app payment works and address bugs. We resolve Bube
            in-App Payment disputes. Email info@Bube.app for payment support. You'll
            receive a response to an email or Bube app query within one business day.
            Bube will handle complaints and applications within two business days.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.6 Upfront fare. You may be able to agree on a set Fare for a Driver's
            service (i.e Upfront Fare). The Bube app shows the upfront fee before a
            journey. Upfront Fare won't be charged if you change your location, if the
            journey takes longer than planned due to traffic or other factors, or if
            anything else unexpected occurs (e.g a route is used where tolls apply).
          </p>

          <h5>4. Transportation services acquisition and disposal</h5>

          <p>
            4.1 You've requested a transportation service if the driver agrees to
            perform it.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 Once a driver agrees to transport you, you'll arrange a separate
            contract with them. You and the driver will set travel terms. Bube doesn't
            give rides, and neither does the driver.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 You terminate a requested transportation service when the driver returns
            and you reject, cancel, or deny it. After a certain period, you must pay a
            cancellation charge if you cancel a transport request.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4 We may temporarily disable your account if you cancel a transport
            request more than once in 24 hours. If you get several warnings, we may
            suspend your account (e.g 6 months). After that, you might ask Bube to
            restore your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.5 If the driver notifies the passenger that the vehicle has arrived, but
            the passenger or individuals who hired the trip don't come within a given
            time, the request will be canceled. Bube isn't liable if a driver cancels
            your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.6 Once the driver comes and notifies you, the Bube app may start charging
            you for waiting time.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.7 If you use the Bube app to seek a ride and damage the driver's car or
            interior (by leaving scratches or stains on it or making it smell terrible),
            the driver may charge you a 10,000 Naira fine and ask for restitution for
            any damages that are larger than the fine. Bube may pay the fee or repair
            the damage if you don't.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            6.8 Bube may immediately ban you from using the Bube app if you breach these
            terms or if we consider it's essential to safeguard Bube's reputation or
            drivers' safety.

            committing fraud, or being disrespectful to the drivers. If any of these
            things happen, your Bube app account might be closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            7.4 Bube will do all it can to ensure only honest, respectful drivers use
            the program. We can't guarantee that every Bube app-found transportation
            provider meets these standards. If you're unhappy with a transportation
            service, contact the firm, a regulatory body, or our customer service.
