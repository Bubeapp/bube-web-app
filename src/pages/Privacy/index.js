            Bube.app ("Bube") cherishes your privacy. In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"),
            we detail the information we gather about you when you visit our website,
            www.bube.app, communication system, or mobile application ("Platform") and
            use the services offered on the Platform ("Services"), as well as how we use

          <p>
            Please email us at support@bube.app if you have any concerns or feedback
            about the Privacy Statement. This Policy is an integral part of and subject
            to the Bube Terms of Service. Your continued use of the Website and/or

          <h3>The categories of personal data we gather and store</h3>

          <p>
            To offer our users with goods, services, and customer support, we gather
            their personal information. Our goods, services, and customer support are
            made available through several platforms, including but not limited to
            websites, mobile applications, email, and the telephone. The exact platform
            and product, service, or support with which you engage might influence the
            personal information we gather.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us qualifies as
            "Personal Information" since it does not identify you as an individual. This
            will include the vast majority of "User Generated Content" that you submit
            to us with the goal of sharing it with other users. Such "Non-Personally
            Identifiable Information" is not covered by this policy. As non-personal
            information may be aggregated or connected to existing personal information,
            it will be considered as personal information when in this form. For the
            interest of openness, this privacy policy will include both categories of
            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            In some circumstances, users may give us with personal information without
            our request or via mechanisms not designed for the acquisition of certain
            categories of information. While we may take reasonable measures to secure
            this data, the user will have circumvented our systems, procedures, and
            control; as a result, the submitted information will not be subject to this
            privacy policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            In some instances, users may give us with personal information through
            channels outside our control, such as social media or online forums. While
            any information acquired by us is subject to our Privacy Policy, the
            platform via which it was transmitted has its own Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h3>How we acquire individual data</h3>

          <h4>Information that you provide expressly</h4>

          <p>
            While using our goods and services, you may be required to provide certain
            kinds of personal data. This may occur through our website, apps, online
            chat services, the telephone, paper forms, or face-to-face encounters. We
            will provide you with a Collection Notice at the time of collection to
            describe how we will use the personal information we request. The
            notification may be given orally or in writing.

          <p>
            Users may grant us permission to acquire personal information from their
            accounts on other platforms. This includes Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google,
            among others. The collected information will be governed by this Privacy
            Policy. By blocking our access on the other platform or by contacting our
            support staff, users may prevent us from gathering data from other
            platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users may invite non-users to our site by giving contact information such as
            an email address. We will collect and retain this information in order to
            contact the non-user and prevent misuse of the invitation systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your payment service provider may send payment-related information that we
            may collect or handle.
          </p>

          <p>
            In some instances, users' personal information may be obtained from public
            sources.
          </p>

            <li>User Generated Content - profile of the user.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>We gather information when you use our service.</h4>

          <p>
            We keep records of our contacts with our users, including the goods,
            services, and customer service we've offered. This includes interactions
            that our users make with our platform, such as viewing a website or clicking
            a button.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may passively collect your GPS coordinates, if accessible from your
            device, in order to offer certain goods or services. When our platform seeks
            this data, the majority of contemporary devices like smartphones will show a
            permission request.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may gather personal information inherent to the conversation when we are
            contacted. For instance, if we get an email, we will collect the email
            address that was used.
          </p>

            <li>
              Actions such as pages seen, buttons clicked, viewing duration, search
              terms, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Links to outside websites</h4>

          <p>
            You will find connections to third-party websites on our website. These
            links may originate from us, or they may appear as user-generated content.
            These external websites are not under our control, and we cannot be held
            liable for their behavior. Before sharing your personal information through
            any other website, we suggest you to review the website's terms of service
            and privacy statement.
          </p>

          <h4>How we use personal data</h4>

          <p>
            The information we seek, collect, and process is used solely to provide
            users with the desired product or service. We may use your personal
            information for the following particular purposes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>To offer you with the required service or product;</li>

            <li>
              To enable the establishment of a User Contract (for further details, see
              the Terms of Service);
            </li>

            <li>To give you with technical or other help;</li>

            <li>To react to inquiries about our services or to a complaint;</li>

            <li>
              To promote our other programs, goods, and services that may be of interest
              to you (unless you opt out of receiving such messages);
            </li>

            <li>To enable debugging, testing, and general platform operation;</li>

            <li>
              To undertake data analysis, research, and develop our platforms in various
              ways;
            </li>

            <li>To meet legal and regulatory requirements;</li>

            <li>If authorized or required by law otherwise; or</li>

            <li>
              For additional purposes with your approval, unless you withdraw that
              consent.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The 'lawful processing' justifications for using personal information about
            our users include (but are not limited to):
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>When the user has consented;</li>

            <li>Where required to fulfill a contract to which the user is a party;</li>

            <li>Processing is required to fulfill our legal commitments;</li>

            <li>
              The processing is required to safeguard the vital interests of a user or
              another natural person.
            </li>

            <li>
              the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests,
              provided that these interests do not override the rights of our users.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We use automated decision making to assist in linking people with
            employment. This is accomplished mostly by how we rank users. These rankings
            are determined by analyzing user-generated material, user activity, and the
            result of tasks; in this context, user-generated content will consist of
            reviews that users obtain for completing jobs. These rating guidelines are
            covered in further detail in our community articles. In addition to
            recommending possible employment to our consumers, automated decision making
            is employed as part of our marketplace security mechanisms.
          </p>

          <h4>When we share sensitive information</h4>

          <h5>Our external service providers</h5>

          <p>

            the personal information of our users outside of Australia, including "in
            the cloud." Our third-party service providers are contractually obligated to
            use your personal information exclusively on our behalf and in accordance
            with our instructions.

          <h4>External applications</h4>

          <p>
            Users are able to offer access to their Bube account to third-party apps
            using the Bube API. Depending on the permissions provided, these programs
            may have access to certain personal information or perform activities on
            behalf of the user. These third-party apps are not under our control and are
            subject to their own privacy policies. Through their settings, users may
            prevent third-party programs from accessing their data.
          </p>

          <h4>Other transfers and disclosures</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>If required to offer the desired service or product;</li>

              We receive court orders, subpoenas, or other law enforcement demands for
              information;
            </li>
            <li>If authorized or required by law otherwise; or</li>

            As a worldwide organization with locations in several countries, your
            personal information may be handled by personnel in any of our offices.
            Currently, Bube has an office in Nigeria.
          </p>

          <p>Accessing, editing, and downloading your personal data</p>

          <p>
            You may seek access to the personal information bube maintains on you.
            Unless an exemption applies, we must provide you with access to the personal
            information we maintain about you within a reasonable time frame and at no
            cost. You may access the majority of your personal information by login into
            your account. If you desire to obtain non-platform-accessible information or
            wish to download all of your personal information in a portable data format,
            please contact our Privacy Officer.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may also request corrections to the personal information we maintain on
            you. Through the user settings sections, you may modify all of your personal
            details. Please contact our customer service if you need help.
          </p>

          <p>Using your additional legal rights</p>

          <p>
            There may be limits on how you may exercise your rights. This is primarily
            attributable to the nature of the goods and services that we provide. The
            majority of the data we gather is used to establish contracts between users,
            facilitate payments, and safeguard the genuine users of our marketplace;
            these data uses are protected against the rights listed below.
          </p>

          <p>You are permitted to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Seek human evaluation of automated decision-making and profiling</li>
            <li>Opt-out from direct marketing and marketing profiling</li>
            <li>Erasure</li>
            <li>Temporary processing constraint</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Human review of automated decision making / profiling - In the case of our
            ranking algorithms, it is not feasible to exercise this right, since this
            ranking is a basic component of the marketplace in which users engage;
            opting out would prevent users from participating in the marketplace. Humans
            already assess decisions that influence the security of the marketplace.
          </p>

          <p>
            Direct marketing and profiling - via their settings page, individuals may
            decide which emails they receive.
          </p>

          <p>
            The majority of personal information and user-generated material cannot be
            removed since they are essential to maintain contracts between users, record
            financial transactions, and safeguard other genuine marketplace users. In
            the event of non-personal data that may be associated with personal data,
            the non-personal data will be deleted or anonymized.
          </p>

          <p>
            Temporary limitation to processing - you may exercise this right in specific
            situations, including if you feel that the personal data we hold about you
            is inaccurate or that we do not have reasonable reasons to process your
            information. In any event, this right may be exercised by contacting our
            privacy officer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, users may exercise their rights by contacting
            our Privacy Officer.
          </p>

          <p>To get in touch with our Privacy Officer</p>

          <p>
            If you have a question, concern, or complaint about how we manage your
            personal information, or if you want to exercise your privacy rights in
            connection to the personal information we maintain about you, please contact
            our Privacy Officer as indicated below:

            desire to file a formal privacy complaint, we ask that you submit your
            grievance in writing to our Privacy Officer, at the address shown above. We
